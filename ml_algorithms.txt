MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

Classification
Clustering
Regression


CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM: 

Ensemble algorithm: It combines several machine learning techniques to create on predictive model inorder to reduce bias, variance or improve predictions. Example; Movie ratings.

Naive Bayes algorithm: This technique is based on Bayes Theorem. The algorithm assumes that a particular feature is independent of all other features in the dataset.  Example; Spam filtering

Decision Trees: This algorithm is used to solve both classification and regression problems. It predicts the value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules


CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS

Kmeans Clustering is an iterative algorithm that splits the dataset into clusters where each datapoint belongs to only one group. Example; Analyzing the spending habit of credit card users

Mean Shift Clustering shifts each point in the dataset until its at the top of the nearest KDE(Kernel Density Estimation) surface peak. Example; Image segmentation

Gaussian Mixture Models groups data points belonging to a single distribution together


REGRESSION ALGORITHMS

Simple Linear Regression: This is used to study relationships between two continuous variables. Example; Real Estate Pricing

Logistic Regression: Describes the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal or ordinal independent variables. Example; Credit Card Fraud Detection

Multiple Linear Regression models the relationship between two or more features and a response by fitting a linear equation to observed data
